# Tic-Tac-Toe for Node Console

This was my first real JavaScript project. It’s a Tic-Tac-Toe game for the Node console (human-vs-human only). Actually, it’s *two* Tic-Tac-Toe games: there’s the normal version, and there’s the “plus” version that prompts you to choose a board-size before the game begins.

To play, first make sure you have Node installed. Then download the repository, navigate to the project’s folder in your terminal, and run `npm install`. Once that’s done, you can play the normal game from that directory with `node TicTacToe.js` and the “plus” version with `node TicTacToePlus.js`.
